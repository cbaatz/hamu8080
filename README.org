* Hamu 8080 -- a simple Intel 8080 machine code emulator

Hamu 8080 is a simple Intel 8080 machine code emulator written in
Haskell intended only for instruction and fun. Inspiration was Charles
Petzold's excellent [[http://www.charlespetzold.com/code/][CODE -- /The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware
and Software/]]. Since the emulator doesn't support input/output it
can't be of any "serious" use. Also, programs are loaded as lists of
pure machine codes -- there isn't even an assembly Haskell DSL. All
instructions apart from OUT/IN have been implemented however (but not
rigorously tested).

** Possible Extensions
*** Input/output in some form
*** Simple assembler
*** Load program from file
*** Add log to computation
*** Abstract out specific RAM type
